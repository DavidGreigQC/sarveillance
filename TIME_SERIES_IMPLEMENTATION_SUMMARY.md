# Time Series Visualization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive time series visualization system for analyzing oil spill detections over 548 days with advanced analytics including trend analysis, seasonal patterns, and weather correlations.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical correlation between detections and 6 weather parameters
- **Moving Averages**: Calculates 7-day and 30-day moving averages

### 4. Main Visualization Screen (`lib/screens/time_series_screen.dart`)
Created a tabbed interface with 4 main sections:

#### Timeline Tab

- Quarterly breakdown of trends
- Color-coded trend indicators

#### Seasonal Tab
- Monthly bar chart with season-coded colors
- Seasonal comparison pie chart
- Expandable season details with characteristics
- Peak season identification
- Monthly average calculations

#### Weather Tab
- Top weather correlations ranked by strength
- Scatter plots for each weather parameter
- Correlation strength indicators
- Interpretation of correlation results
- Color-coded correlation strength

### 5. Widget Components

#### Trend Analysis Card (`lib/widgets/trend_analysis_card.dart`)
- Visual trend direction indicator
- Confidence level display
- Quarterly segment breakdown
- Slope calculations for each quarter
- Color-coded status indicators

#### Seasonal Pattern Card (`lib/widgets/seasonal_pattern_card.dart`)
- Peak season highlighting
- Expandable season details
- Seasonal characteristics
- Average and peak detection values
- Season-specific icons and colors

#### Weather Correlation Card (`lib/widgets/weather_correlation_card.dart`)
- Ranked correlation display
- Strength indicators with progress bars
- Positive/negative correlation indicators
- Detailed interpretation text
- Educational legend

### 6. Navigation Integration
- Added button in Analyze screen app bar
- Easy access via chart icon
- Smooth navigation transition
- Maintains app structure
